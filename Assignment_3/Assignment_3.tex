\section{Problem 2.6}
\textbf{Problem}: A manufacturer has three machine operators
A, B and C. The first operator A produces
$1\%$ defective items, where as the other two
operators B and C produce $5\%$ and $7\%$
defective items respectively. A is on the job
for $50\%$ of the time, B is on the job for $30\%$
of the time and C is on the job for $20\%$ of
the time. A defective item is produced, what
is the probability that it was produced by A?
\\
\\
\textbf{Solution :}

 Let\\
A : Event that item produced by operator A \\
B : Event that item produced by operator B \\
C : Event that item produced by operator C \\
D : Event that item produced is defective \\

We need to find out the probability that the item is produced by the operator A is defective \\
 i.e.$P(A|D)$ \\
 $$P(A|D) = \frac{P(A).P(D|A)}{P(A).P(D|A) + P(B).P(D|B) + P(C).P(D|C)}$$ \\
 P(A) =  Probability of item is produced by operator A \\
 =$ 50\% = \frac{50}{100} = 0.5$ \\
  P(B) =  Probability of item is produced by operator B\\
 =$ 30\% = \frac{30}{100} = 0.3$ \\
  P(C) =  Probability of item is produced by operator C\\
 =$ 20\% = \frac{20}{100} = 0.2$ \\
  $P(D|A)$ =  Probability of a defective item is produced by operator A \\
 =$ 1\% = \frac{1}{100} = 0.01$ \\
  $P(D|B)$ =  Probability of a defective item is produced by operator B \\
 =$ 5\% = \frac{5}{100} = 0.05$ \\
  $P(D|C)$ =  Probability of a defective item is produced by operator C \\
 =$ 7\% = \frac{7}{100} = 0.07$ \\
 Putting the values in the formula :\\
  $$P(A|D) = \frac{P(A).P(D|A)}{P(A).P(D|A) + P(B).P(D|B) + P(C).P(D|C)}$$ \\
  \begin{align*}
&=\frac{0.5 * 0.01}{0.5 * 0.01 + 0.3 * 0.05 + 0.2 * 0.07}\\
&= \frac{0.005}{0.005 + 0.015 + 0.014 }\\
&=\frac{0.005}{0.034}\\
&=\frac{5}{34}\\
&=0.147
  \end{align*}
Therefore, required probability = 0.147
